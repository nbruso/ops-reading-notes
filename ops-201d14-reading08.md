What is the Windows Registry, and what does it store?

There are system-wide registry settings for all users and also user-specific settings.

What are “registry hacks” and why might someone want to use them?

Hackig or altering the registry is helpgul when you're looking for options to modify something that isnt normally obviously available in Windows. 
There are some things you can only achieve by hacking the registry and registry hacks online will tell you exactly what to change.


What are some common tasks you can perform by editing the Windows Registry?

Some common tasks you can perform by editing the registry include making Windows always show a message whenever someone signs into the computer and preventing other user accounts from running specific applications on your system.

Imagine you’re explaining the concept of the Windows Registry to someone who has never used a computer before. How would you make this explanation culturally relevant and relatable to their life experiences or background?

I think I could explain it like ther registry is a hard copy personel file system like HR would keep. HR files contain information about a person and can include documentation on restrictions within the company.  Only HR knows how to change them so you have to figure out the right paperwork to file if you wanted to give an employee different access.
