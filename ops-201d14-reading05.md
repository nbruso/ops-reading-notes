# Reading notes 5

How can you list the files in the current directory using the command prompt?

With the command "dir".

How might the “sfc” command and the “gpupdate” command help in troubleshooting on Windows?

SFC stands for System File Checker and scans all files of the core operating system to check for damages. Gpupdate forces updates on a computer which may solve issues a user is having.

What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?

Robocopy allows you to resume file transfer even if it gets interupted in the middle. Xcopy allows you to copy multiple files at a time, but would't resume if interupted. The robocopy command would work well if there is intermittent connectivity. 


Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation.

The only one I can think of is using gpupdate on the computers within a hospital. The computer we had would often slow down and need various updates, but we were always to busy to complete them. This would essentially force the updates at a certain time.
