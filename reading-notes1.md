Q:How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?

A: A hardware hack attacks the physical components of the machine rather than the software running on the machine.

Q:What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?

A: One way is called interdiction where they can attach something to the computer during the process of transporting it to the consumer. The other method is to implant something on the hardware at the beginning of manufacturing. 

Q:Explain how the hack worked.

A: Spies at a manufacturing company called Supermicro implanted chips into motherboards of different companies including US government agencies. The micochips were designed to camouflage with the motherboard and were only detectable with special equipment. The microchips changed the instructions given to the motherboard and CPU including telling the device to communicate with another computer somewhere else, and preparing the operating system to accept their code.

Q:How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?

A: U.S. officials followed Supermicro's supply chain back to the source. They tracked the chips to four different subcontractors in China. They discovered The People's Liberation Army in China bribed or threatened plant managers to alter the motherboards.
