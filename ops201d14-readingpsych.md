Reading notes 

1) What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

Three key factors for psychologically safe teams are open and honest communication, empathy and sensitivity, and emotional bonds.

2) Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

In a previous team/unit I worked on, there was a fear of sharing ideas, a lack of empathy, and cliques that affected psychological safety.  New nurses were treated with hostility and were afraid to ask questions.

3) What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

Teams with high psychological safety increase innovation, problem-solving, and employee well-being, and they often have lower turnover rates.
