   - **A:** `Bridged Adapter` mode.

3. **What are the three options of promiscuous mode and what does each do?**

   - **A:**
     - **Deny:** VM only sees its own traffic.
     - **Allow VMs:** VM sees traffic to/from other VMs.
     - **Allow All:** VM sees all incoming and outgoing traffic.

4. **What is Port Forwarding?**
