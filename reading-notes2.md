## Answers to questions
Q:Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
A: A high speed allows for faster processing of data. More cores improved performance. Therefore, the speed and cores you may need depend on how you are primarily using the machine. Typically CPUs have 4 or 6 cores. Only top level gaming machines would need more than 6 cores.

Q:What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
A: You first want to check to make sure the CPU has the next conections for your motherboard. Then you want to evaluate if it has wifi capability, bluetooth, the RAM speed, and any graphics cards.

Q:What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
A: You would want to evaulate the difference between a HDD (hard disk drive) and an SSD (solid state drive).  The SSD is more expensive, but conects with the newer form of connectors called SATA.  SSDs are also smaller in size.

Q:Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
A: I'm a registered nurse, so I could explain the computer parts in terms of anatomical terms.  The CPU might be the heart, the motherboard could be described as a complete body system, storage or memory could be the brain.
