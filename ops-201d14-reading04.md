# Reading notes 4

Q: What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?

A: Break the issues up and go through the troubleshooting process individually with each problem.


Q: What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?

A: You need to implement the solution. This may require specific timing based on the system.


Q: What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?

A: This allows anyone else who may experience the problem to already have acccess to the solution process.


Q:Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?

A: As an RN, we often have many patients which medical devices and often their first language is not English. I've had patients who are having issues with say a glucometer or insulin pump for diabetes. They know something is wrong, but maybe can't explain it correctly due to terminology or due to language barrier. That's why it becomes important, like in the CompTia methodology, to break down the issues in to simplier parts and solve each individually. It also becomes very importat to document the issue and how it was solved so if the patient ever comes back with the problem, the solution will already be in their chart.
