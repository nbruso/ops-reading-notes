Monitoring Patients: ICU nurses closely monitor patients' vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and temperature. They also keep a watchful eye on changes in the patient's condition

Administering Medications: They are responsible for administering medications and treatments as prescribed by physicians, often involving intravenous (IV) medications.

Assessing Patient Condition: ICU nurses assess and document the patient's condition, noting any changes or deterioration. They work closely with healthcare teams to adjust treatment plans accordingly.

Ventilator Management: In cases where patients require mechanical ventilation, ICU nurses are trained to manage and monitor ventilators, ensuring proper oxygenation and ventilation.
