What are some common indicators that an SSD may be failing?

Common SSD Failure Indicators include: Bad blocks causing data failures and system prompts to repair the file system; crashing during boot-up, indicating possible SSD failure; operating in read-only mode, suggesting drive corruption. This is because SSDs are silent and don't emit sounds like HDDs so warning signs are less apparent.

How do SSD failures differ from HDD failures in terms of detectability?

SSD failures differ from HDD failures because SSDs fail suddenly and may not have obvious signs and HDDs can produce audible warning sounds. Some SSD issues are also less detectable, which makes prevention important. 

What are bad blocks in an SSD, and how do they affect its performance?

Bad blocks are flawed memory cells affecting data storage. Symptoms of a bad block include data failures, system prompts, and slow operation. An SSD with a bad block usually has to be backedup and replaced.

How can power cycling an SSD help resolve certain issues?

Power cycling can help with corrupted SSDs. The process involves unplugging it, cycling power, and reconnecting it. It can resolve issues like frozen drives.

How might this topic be relevant in the aftermath of a natural disaster? 

In the aftermath of a natural disaster, regular backups and cloud storage can safeguard data and recovery services can help retrieve data from damaged devices.

Describe how individuals or communities can use these techniques to recover data and resume their normal activities

Using the techniques in the article individuals and communities can effectively recover their data and return to normal activities after a natural disaster, minimizing data loss and downtime. This would require communities to do regular backups and potentially have multiple different sources of backups before a disaster happens.  In addiiton, power cycling or idling in the boot menu, as mentioned in the article, may help with SSD recovery after power-related issues.
