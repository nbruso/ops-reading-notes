Q: What is the primary function of a shell in a computerâ€™s operating system?

A: The shell enables humans to interact with the computer when they want to.

Q: How does Bash locate and execute commands on a Linux or Unix system?

A: It searches directories on your  computer to see if the command exists. If it does exist, it executes the command. 


Q: How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell?

A: You execute the echo command along with a special character specific to the currently running process. 


Q: What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable?

A: Scripting refers to the ability to type the commands you want into a plain text file and have Bash run them in the background instead of running them one by one. This is considered powerful because scripting allows you to perform multiple functions on your computer without manually typing them in yourself.


Q: Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks.

A: I think the best example I can think of from my time as an RN would be the use of medication pumps. Without medication pumps, you have to manually count the drips of a medication to ensure it's going into the patient at the desired rate. With a pump you can tell the machine how fast you want the medication to run, how long you want it to run for, and other customizations that will allow you to perform other nursing tasks while the patient receives their medication.
