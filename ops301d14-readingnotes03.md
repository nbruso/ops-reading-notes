# Part 1:

Q. **What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?**

   A. *CIDR Notation:* A way to represent a range of IP addresses.
    *CIDR Block:* Simply, a specific range of IP addresses.

Q. **How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?**

   A. It's divided into four parts, called octets.

Q. **Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?**

   A. In the decimal system, each octet ranges from 0 to 255.

Q. **What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?**

   A. It indicates how many bits are used for the network part of the IP address.

Q. **How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?**

   A. It gives a range of 256 IP addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255.

   # Part 2

Q. **In your own words, describe network segmentation.**

A. Network segmentation is the divison of different parts of the computer. It separates parts of a computer network for better security and control.

Q. **Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well-configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?**

A. I would say disagree. Firewalls are good guards, but network segmentation adds extra protection and firewalls might not be enough to protect against all kinds of attacks.

Q. **What is a screened subnet?**

A. A screened subnet is zone separated by a firewall. It holds things like public websites, keeping them apart from the private network.

Q. **Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors, and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?**

A. Physical security measures.
