What is the difference between Bash and PowerShell?

Bash is a Unix-based shell and command language that can be used for task automation and management. It passes information through plan text and works with strings.  In contrast, Powershell is Microsoft command line based. It is a complete scripting environment that can share complex data. Powershell works with objects rather than strings.

In what scenarios or environments can you use PowerShell? Name some major platforms where PowerShell is supported.

Most major platforms are capable of running Powershell including AWS, Oracle cloud, Windows, Linux, VMware, and Azure.

List at least three reasons why learning PowerShell could be beneficial for your career and environment.

Because Powershell is so versatile and available on so many platforms, it means you only have to learn it once and can use it multiple places. This can also give you a competetive edge in the job market.  Powershell can also allow you to accomplish tasks quicker because the automation capabilities allow you to accomplish similar tasks in a fraction of the time.  It can improve accuracy because PowerShell tests outcomes for every initiative.


How can PowerShellâ€™s automation capabilities improve efficiency and reduce manual errors?

PowerShell's automation capabilities allow you to perform tasks more efficiently and with greater precision than with manual entry.  PowerShell allows you to create scripts that automate repetitive tasks removing the need for manual entry which can be entered incorrectly. 


Think about a situation where you might use PowerShell in your everyday life or job. How could PowerShell help you accomplish a specific task or solve a problem?

As I nurse it's interesting having started this course to think back on how truly awful the software is that we have to use to chart.  Even the most widely used programs don't even have a way to alert you when it's getting close to the time a patient's medicaiton is due. With Powershell, you could do something like create a script that sends automated medication reminders to the a computer or other device. This would have been extremely helpful when dealing with multiple patients.
