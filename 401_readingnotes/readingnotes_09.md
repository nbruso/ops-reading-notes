# Reading Notes 9

**Name the three main components which make up PKI.**

The three main components of PKI are Certificate Authorities (CAs), digital certificates, and cryptographic keys (including private and public keys).

**How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.**

PKI acts like a digital passport system. It verifies that the website you're visiting is actually the one it claims to be, just like a passport confirms someone's identity. This ensures that the information you send to and receive from the website is secure and can't be used by others.

**What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?**

The main weakness of PKI architecture is that any Certificate Authority can issue a certificate for any entity, which can lead to trust issues. This means there's a risk of certificates being misused by unauthorized parties.
