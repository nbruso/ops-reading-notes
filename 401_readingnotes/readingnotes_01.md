# 401 Reading Notes 1: Strategic Policy Development

1. **How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC 2 compliance?**

   I would emphasize that SOC 2 compliance builds trust with customers, partners, and prospects. It showcases a commitment to security, which is crucial in today's landscape of data breaches. Additionally, being SOC 2 compliant is often a prerequisite for working with enterprise-level clients.

2. **What are the five SOC 2 Trust Principles?**

   - **Security:** Ensure protection against unauthorized access (e.g., data breaches).
   - **Confidentiality:** Safeguard sensitive information from disclosure.
   - **Availability:** Assure systems and data are accessible as needed.
   - **Integrity:** Prevent unauthorized data alteration.
   - **Privacy:** Protect personal information throughout its lifecycle.

3. **How would you explain the three levels of the SOC 2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues in healthcare would understand?**

   Think of the SOC 2 pyramid as providing patient care. Policies are like clinical guidelines, setting the foundation for quality care. Procedures are the specific steps you take in treating a patient, ensuring consistency and adherence to standards. Proof is the detailed documentation of each patient interaction, showing that you followed the procedures correctly. It's about building a solid framework for delivering secure and compliant healthcare services, just like ensuring the best patient care.
