1. **What are three tasks which SOCs often perform?**

   - Monitoring for security incidents, threats, and breaches.
   - Analyzing and investigating security trends to understand and prevent future breaches.
   - Managing firewalls and intrusion prevention systems.

2. **Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms.**

   A SIEM solution is like a central command system that collects and organizes all the security-related information from different parts of an organization's network. The SOC uses it to quickly identify and respond to any unusual or harmful activities. This makies it easier to keep the network safe.

3. **How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk.**

   The structure of a typical SOC team is usually hierarchical like an IT Help Desk. It starts with Level 1, the first responders who monitor alerts and decide on their urgency. Level 2 handles incident resolution, Level 3 focuses on proactive security operations, and Level 4 consists of managers overseeing all activities. Level 4 is like escalated support levels in an IT Help Desk.
