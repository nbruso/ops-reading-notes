# Reading Notes 7

- **From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.**
  - **Data at Rest**: 
    - Stored emails my inbox.
    - Downloaded or temporarily cached videos.
    - Saved bookmarks and browser history.
  - **Data in Transit**:
    - Sending or receiving emails.
    - Loading webpages while browsing.
    - Data streaming during video playback.

- **Explain the role of data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.**
  - **Confidentiality**: Encryption keeps data private and secure, ensuring only authorized individuals can access information. For example, it secures your emails and browsing data from unauthorized access.
  - **Integrity**: It ensures that the data, whether in transit (like during email transmission) or at rest (like saved files), is not tampered with or altered without authorization.
  - **Availability**: While encryption mainly addresses confidentiality and integrity, secure data is more reliably available for authorized use. For example, encrypted emails or files are protected from malicious attacks that might make them inaccessible.
