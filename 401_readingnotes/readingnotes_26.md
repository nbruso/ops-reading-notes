# Reading Notes Class 26

**You just got a new job as a Cyber Threat Analyst, how would you explain your role to a family member?**

As a Cyber Threat Analyst, my job involves monitoring and analyzing potential threats to computer systems and networks.

**Explain what makes PowerShell such an effective attack vector.**

PowerShell is effective for attacks because it's a legitimate tool built into Windows, which makes it trusted and widely used. Attackers exploit its valid use with Windows and its ability to execute commands which can make it difficult to detect malicious activities.

**What are two things you can do to mitigate attacks that leverage PowerShell?**

1. Enable logging features like module logging, script block logging, and PowerShell transcription to track and analyze PowerShell activity.

2. Implement behavior monitoring to detect and block anomalies and strange activities associated with PowerShell-based attacks.
