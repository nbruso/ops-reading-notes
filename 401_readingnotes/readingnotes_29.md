# Reading Notes 29

**Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.**

Threat modeling helps to mitigate these risks, that would prevent things like the security breaches you hear about all the times in the news. You think about what the bad guys may or might do so that you can counteract that before it happens.

**What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?**

The four questions are:
1. What are we working on?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we do a good job?

**You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?**

Threat modeling provides a structured approach to identify and address potential security threats in our application. It helps us understand the risks early in the development process, enabling us to make informed decisions to enhance security. By proactively addressing this, we can minimize the likelihood of security breaches and protect user data.
