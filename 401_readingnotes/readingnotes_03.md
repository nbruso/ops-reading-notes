# Reading Notes 3

1. **Measures for CIA Triad in an ATM:**
   - **Confidentiality:** Use encryption for user data during transactions.
   - **Integrity:** Use digital signatures to detect and prevent unauthorized changes.
   - **Availability:** Have redundant systems to prevent service disruptions.

2. **Three Best Practices for CIA Triad:**
   - **Separation of Duties:** Prevents concentration of power, enhancing confidentiality. The goal is to prevent a single person from having complete control or authority over a process, system, or sensitive information.
   - **Mandatory Vacations:** Detects potential security issues during an employee's absence by requiring employees to take breaks of vacatios from their work. When employees take time off, it becomes an opportunity for the organization to detect any irregularities or potential security issues that might have been hidden while the employee was present.
   - **Least Privilege:** Limits user access to only necessary functions, supporting confidentiality.

3. **Three Stages of Risk Management Lifecycle:**
   - **Risk Assessment:**
     - Identify, classify, and evaluate assets, threats, and vulnerabilities based on certain parameters for a specific period. Must be reevaluated periodcially. Includes system characterization, threat identification, and vulerability identification and others.
   - **Risk Analysis:**
     - Qualitatively and quantitatively assess risks using factors like asset value, exposure, ARO, risk value.
   - **Risk Mitigation:**
     - Reduce, transfer, or accept risks; requires ongoing monitoring to comply with security governance like ITIL or OCTAVE.
