# Reading Notes 8

**How would you convince your organization about the importance of implementing a DLP solution?**

I would emphasize the increase in data breaches, the growing compliance mandates, and the financial and reputational risks of losing sensitive data. I'd also emphasize how DLP can protect against insider threats and help manage data effectively across various platforms and cloud services.

**How would you explain the three main use cases for DLP to friends or family?**
To explain DLP to friends/family I would say: DLP is like your own private security guard and there are three main uses:

1. protecting personal information like health or credit card details

2. keeping a company's secret information safe

3. giving a clear view of how data moves and is used in a company
